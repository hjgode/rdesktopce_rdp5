WinRdesktop

MANY THANKS to Adam B., Trent M. and Brad H. for getting SSL and TLS 1.0 working

A free rdp client for Windows Mobile

Usage:
  WinRDesktop - an RDP client based on rdesktop
  You can't run this application without correct parameters
  
  command line options
  
  WinRDesktop [-g widthxheight] [-t port] [-a bpp]
      [-u username] [-p password] [-d domain]
      [-s shell] [-n host name]
      server-name-or-ip
  
  not supported: [-c working directory], [-f] , clipboard
  
  You can use a config file in the current or root directory
  called WinRDesktop.ini
  The file should look like this:
  
  [main]
  server=192.168.1.1
  port=3389
  username=user1
  password=password1
  bpp=8/15/16
  geometry=800x600

			fullscreen (-f) currently not supported, does not make sense
			
			VK_CAPITAL only applied to letters not to numbers
			Only letters (A-z) and digits (0-9) work on default SIP
			Shifted standard SIP is also OK
			in Number SIP chars are mixed up
			
			WM_CHAR not supported, need KEY_UP/KEY_DOWN
			
			added code to allow only one instance!

			fullscreen implemented this way:
			use geometry=240x320 and fullscreen on a QVGA device and you will get a fullscreen 
			window without scrollbars
			if geometry is larger than device screen, you will get scrollbars but there is no
			window caption and no menubar (what I call fullscreen).
			
			To exit rdesktop in full screen mode double click in the middle of the top (imaginary)
			caption and you will be asked for exit.
